Statistical frequency analysis for ranking Caesar cipher brute-force results

Provides the FrequencyAnalyzer class that scores decryption candidates
by comparing their letter distributions against expected English frequency
percentages using a chi-squared test. Lower scores indicate text that
more closely matches natural English.

Connects to:
  constants.py - imports ENGLISH_LETTER_FREQUENCIES
  main.py - crack command passes CaesarCipher.crack() output to rank_candidates()
