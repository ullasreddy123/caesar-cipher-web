test_cipher.py

Tests for CaesarCipher covering encryption, decryption, and brute-force cracking

Tests:
  encrypt/decrypt correctness for upper, lower, and mixed case
  non-letter preservation (spaces, punctuation, numbers)
  encrypt/decrypt roundtrip fidelity
  key validation and edge cases (zero key, negative key, alphabet wrapping)
  crack() generating all 26 shifts and locating the correct one

Connects to:
  cipher.py - the class under test
